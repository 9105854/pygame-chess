# Pygame Chess

A personal project that implements chess in pygame. It uses the python-chess module to interface with stockfish and keep track of board state and moves. 

This is still in development. 

## To Run
Download folder or use git clone
Download stockfish locally
Change path in main.py to the path of your stockfish engine
The one in the repository won't work unless you use AMD and Linux
